Resources
--------------------
The following is a list of REST Resources URLs available in the pyzombie
RESTful server.

Any resource that responds to a GET shall respond to a HEAD method. All REST
resources shall respond to the OPTIONS method which shall return other available
methods and a URL to reference documentation for that method on that REST
resource.


URL Variable Components:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    myserver
        This is the domain host name that has the pyzombie server.
    8008
        This is the default port of the pyzombie server.
    myexec
        This is the pyzombie generated unique executable name.
    myinstance
        This is the pyzombie generated unique executable instance name.


URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

\http://myserver:8008/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    GET
        Return the set of executables available on this server.
        
        **Representation:**
            ``Content-Type``
                * ``application/yaml``
                * ``text/html``
                * ``application/xhtml+xml``
        
    POST
        Add a new executable to the set of available executables.
        
        **Request**
            ``Content-Type``
                This should be a recognized internet media type that will
                allow proper execution of the uploaded file. If this is not
                given then ``application/octet-stream`` will be used and may
                result in execution failre.
        
        **Response**
            ``Location``: executable URL


\http://myserver:8008/add
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    GET
        Return an HTML form to allow a new executable image to be uploaded
        to this server.

        **Representation:**
            ``Content-Type``

                * ``application/xhtml+xml``

        
    POST
        Add a new executable to the set of available executables.
        
        **Request**
            ``Content-Type``
                * ``multipart/form-data`` for executables uploaded from a form.
        
        **Response**
            ``Location``: executable information page


\http://myserver:8008/myexec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    GET
        Return the executable image.

        **Representation:**
            ``Content-Type``
                * ``text/plain`` for interpreted executables (should have '#!')
                * ``application/octet-stream`` for compiled executables.

    PUT
        Change the executable image.

        **Request**
            ``Content-Type``
                This must be a recognized internet media type that is the
                same as the original executable: i.e. changing file types
                from Python to Perl is not allowed. If this is not given
                then ``application/octet-stream`` will be used as a default.
        
        **Status**
        
        1. ``200 (OK)`` if no instances of the executable are active.

    DELETE
        Remove the named executable from the set of available executables, and
        remove any associated data.
        
        **Status**
        
        1. ``200 (OK)`` if no instances of the executable are active.
        
        2. ``202 (Accepted)`` if an instance of the executable is active.

Representations
--------------------

YAML
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Create Executable Instance::

    ---- # Executable Instance Creation
    type:               //rec

        environment:
            type:       //map

            contents:   {type: //str}
            length:     {min: 1}


* Executable Instance Representation::

    ---- # Executable Instance
    type:               //rec
    required:
        self:           //str   # URL to this representation
        executable:     //str   # URL to the executable representation
        status:         //one
            # Integer is the exit code when instance has terminated
            # String is the ISO 8601 datetime when instance shall be forced to terminate
        remove:         //str   # ISO 8601 datetime the instance is removed
        environment:
            type:       //map
            values:     //str
        arguments:
