pyzombie

This is an HTTP RESTful server that will allow arbitrary code to be executed
on a remote host. The principle purpose is to allow test code to be loaded
and executed remotely on hosts for systems that have no direct network
presence.


    WARNING    WARNING    WARNING    WARNING    WARNING    WARNING
    
Executing pyzombie on any machine will open it up to all attacks by anyone
or anything that has access to the internet (TCP/IP) address and port. There
is no security within pyzombie to prevent unauthorized access.
